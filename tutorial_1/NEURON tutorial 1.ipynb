    "Here we display a pyramidal neuron with two different sections are highlited (red). The problem is that neurons oftentimes have sections with quite different sizes such as long and thick (left) and short and tiny (right). To deal with this problem, each section is divided into **segments**, and so we can divide big sections with many segments while we can keep small ones with less or no segmenting.\n",

For example, if our section has `nseg=3`, membrane potential at three different points, v(x=0.0), v(x=0.5), and v(x=1.0), can be different from each other. However, if `nseg=1`, v(x) will be exactly the same no matter which point we measure --- the section is isopotential. Having this in mind, let's open NEURON and create some sections."
